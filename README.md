# Bacterial-Cooperation
A simulation that shows the effectiveness of Bacterial Cooperation in a colony of bacteria where some are antibiotic resistant and studies 2cases.

Case1: The bacteria move randomly in case of an antibiotic attack.
Case2: The bacteria form a spatial arrangement such that the antibiotic resistant bacteria are able to protect as many of the clan members as they can(by the virtue of the Protein wall)

Both the cases have an additional feature, which is a probability(denoted by beta) of the transfer of the antibiotic resistant properties to some other bacteria.
